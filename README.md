Blood Donation Guidance

People are aware of blood donation, but still hesitate to donate. Many donâ€™t even have basic information about this, sometimes even misinformation. 

Sometimes they are scared, other times they think they are too busy. If they just think how valuable their donation could be to the patients, they may change their minds.


The project is made on a website using Azure. There is also a chatbot which is made using QnA maker and Azure services.

The chatbot helps them about this in a very friendly way. People can interact with it playfully and ask questions, resolve their doubts and then, get to know about the correct information about blood donation. 

The requirements section will help in knowing the current estimate of the blood types to work accordingly.


This project aims to make people aware of the blood donation and provide them with correct information, and inspire for blood donation, so they can act responsibly.
